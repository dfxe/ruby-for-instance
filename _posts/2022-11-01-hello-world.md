# Hello World

You can start off running in Ruby.

|--------------|-----------|------------|
| print with new line after  | `puts "Hello Ruby"`    |
| quick print      | `p "Hello Ruby"`  |
| print on the same line      | `print "Hello Ruby"`  |
|     | `print " on the same line"`  |

&nbsp;

|--------------|-----------|
| Ruby files have the .rb extension. You can run them instantly as they do not have a compilation step. | `$ ruby hello-world.rb`    |
|  | *Hello Ruby*    |
|  | *"Hello Ruby"*    |
|  | *"Hello Ruby on the same line"*    |
