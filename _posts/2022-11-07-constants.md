# Hello World

You can start off running in Ruby.

|--------------|-----------|------------|
| a constant must start with an uppercase letter | `CONSTANT = 42`  | *Hello Ruby*    |
| constants cannot be reassigned a value | `GOLDEN_RATIO = (1 + Math.sqrt(5)) / 2`  |*"Hello Ruby"*    |
|     | `puts CONSTANT, GOLDEN_RATIO`  |   *"Hello Ruby on the same line"*    |

&nbsp;

|--------------|-----------|
| Ruby files have the .rb extension. You can run them instantly as they do not have a compilation step. | `ruby hello-world.rb`    |


```rb
# Define a constant
PI = 3.14159

# Try to change the value of the constant
PI = 3.14 # This will throw an error
```
